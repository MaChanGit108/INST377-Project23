* How to run your application on a server
   - We ran our application on Heroku.
   
* How to run any tests you have written for your software
   - No additional tests written.
   
* The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
   - GET: returns data from a read request
     - a
   - POST: accepts user requests for information
     - a
   - PUT: accepts *different* user requests for information
     - a
   
* A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
   - ROAD-MAP for Next Step: 
      - Implement more features to answer more questions about the given data.
      - Ex: more attributes like zip code that were not addressed in our web application.
      - Implement a spatial visualization of budget payments. 
      - Utilize fiscal data from previous years to understand which sectors of education receive more money and why.
      - Make own local database (NEDB, SQLite) that can store POST information and run on Heroku without an external support.
      - Use React for your front-end, and design it to update dynamically
      - Build your application in a framework like bootstrap and use a colour scheme derived from photos to be in sync
      - Use advanced CSS animations for all your motion on the front end
        - Button clicks, swipes, screen transitions
   - These kind of questionings may even lead us to explore other datasets beyond budget-related data.
