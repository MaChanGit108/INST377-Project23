   - ROAD-MAP for Next Step: 
      - Implement more features to answer more questions about the given data.
      - Ex: more attributes like zip code that were not addressed in our web application.
      - Implement a spatial visualization of budget payments. 
      - Utilize fiscal data from previous years to understand which sectors of education receive more money and why.
   - This kind of questioning may even lead us to explore other datasets beyond budget-related data.
